    /* Float and Double Data Types
       ---------------------------
       Kind Of Data: Real Numbers could have fractions
       Inner Representation:
       - Double: Each data uses 8 bytes (64 bits)
       - Float: Each data uses 4 byte (32 bits)
       The numbers are represented by the floating point methon (IEEE-754)

       C++ Literals
       ------------
       For Double: 3.4, -8.975, 6.0
       For Float: 3.4f, -8.975f
       Artithmetic Operators: +, -, *, /

       Example
       -------
       Please enter the radius 2.6
       The area of a circle with radius of 2.6 is 21.2372

       Theorem
       -------
       Let C be a circle with a radius of length r.

       We have (Area of C) = pi * r^2

       Casting
       -------
       Converting the representation of a data from one type to another type.
